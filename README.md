# JMPlot
A very rudimentary library aiming to be compatible with the MATLAB/Octave 
syntax but for java. It's one of my first projects and lacks major features 
of professional tools.

The package can be used in two ways. Either it can be implemented in AWT or 
Swing GUI or, using the VisualizeData static classes, a plot command can be 
placed anywhere and will behave like it does in traditional beginners .m 
script files. This provides some kind of poor man's debugging.

I wrote this to get to know the way of how to draw on a graphical user 
interface as an exercise. Please do not expect too much. It lacks major 
features you would expect on such plot libraries.

As it's used in the RBMK simulator project, it got some features to add 
multiple y axes like a similar project I released many years ago for MATLAB.
