# Code of Conduct

**tl;dr**: Respect human rights. Don't do actions which undermine them.

As a maintainer and author of this project I want to use this opportunity to 
mark the importance of human rights towards a peaceful existence of mankind.
It is obvious that there are individuals, groups, organisations and even 
governments which actively try to reverse the achievements of peace, freedom and
bodily integrity. This can be summarized as an active denial and teardown of
human rights.

Instead of requiring a certain behaviour or attitude towards anything, I've 
chosen to use a more abstract way on describing what is an essential requirement
to contribute to this project.

Every person who participates in this project (issues, pull requests, 
discussions and so on) must acknowledge, respect and support human rights as 
declared in the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights** from 10 December 1948.

Contributions of any form which directly or indirectly try to undermine human 
rights will not be tolerated and removed. This includes:
* Spreading false information or narratives with clear intentions that do not 
comply with the universal declaration of human rights.
* Any justification of the war against Ukraine.
* Expressions that justify, advocate, or glorify violence or other violations 
of human rights.
* Supporting organisations or governments which actively deny human rights
* **Any** form of intentional discrimination.
* Victim blaming

Diversity means discussion, listening, accepting or even tolerating things
which might be uncomfortable.

Thoughtful, critical discussions that present different viewpoints and 
perspectives are welcomed. It is encouraged to question the way things are and 
present alternative ways and solutions. It is likely to happen that technical
details will be discussed with emotions and disagreements.
